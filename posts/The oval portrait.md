####  Reference to the context

**a. What is the central theme of the story? Who is the woman depicted in the oval portrait?**

&#x279E; The story “The Oval Portrait” deals with the theme of relationship between art and life. Art and obsession to it are showed as killers and  responsible for the young bride’s death. In this context, art is equivalent to death. The association between art and life is considered as rivalry. In the story it is suggested that art can reveal the artist’s guilt or evil and may even destroy the life.

The woman depicted in the oval portrait is the wife of the painter and the victim of the painter’s passion for the portrait.

**b. “The Oval Portrait” is a short horror story by Edgar Allan Poe involving disturbing circumstances surrounding a portrait in a Chateau. Elaborate.**

&#x279E; The story “The Oval Portrait” is a short horror story with its dark setting and mood of the narration. It is set in a gloomy abandoned mansion. Although the mansion is deserted, it contains objects of a dark and mysterious past – such as the oval portrait itself. The image of the remote abandoned chateau is given a hint of mystery and gloom. The antiquity of the interior where its walls are decorated with tapestry and manifold and multiform armorial trophies, and a great number of spirited modern paintings. The dark setting and shadowy circumstances of the prior events provide the impression that the story has a bizarre twist. The reader’s anticipation of mystery is sustained by the appearance of a lifelike portrait of a woman in one of the darker nooks of the mysterious room.

**c. The Oval Portrait suggests that the woman’s beauty condemns her to death. Discuss.**

&#x279E; The references of the painting state that the young lady in the portrait is very beautiful. She loses her life because her husband compels her to sit for many weeks in an attempt to make the most beautiful portrait of her. Though the lady sits next to her husband, he is so immersed in his painting to create a beautiful portrait of his wife. But he doesn’t realize his wife’s life withdrawing from her body slowly. It reveals the sad reality of the husband’s failure to witness the beauty of his wife. As he was an artist, he wants to treasure it in the form of a portrait. In this way, her beauty condemns her to own death.

**d. Discuss the story as a frame narrative (a story within a story)**

&#x279E; The Oval Portrait is a frame narrative, or a story that contains another story. In the first part of the story, we encounter the unnamed narrator, who is injured and stranded at night for unknown reasons. He along with his companion and servant, Pedro, take shelter in an abandoned mansion. The narrator stays awake while his servant sleeps. He is captivated by the paintings on the bedroom wall and studies  book containing their history. Noticing a lifelike painting of a young woman, he reads about it in the book.

In the second section, the narrator tells how a beautiful woman marries a painter who is completely absorbed in his work. Although she doesn’t love this, she agrees to sit for a portrait, a process that takes many weeks. As the portrait nears completion, the lady grows increasingly weak. In placing the final touches of his masterpiece on the canvas, he suddenly realizes that she is dead.

**e. The story is told in a descriptive style, with plenty of imagery and symbolism. Which images and symbols do you find in the story?**

&#x279E; The mansion is abandoned and worn-out. The turret room is in a remote section of the mansion. The room is rich in decorations, but they are tattered and antique. The walls are full of tapestries, trophies, and spirited modern paintings. This vivid description of the mansion provides the gothic image. Likewise,the descriptions of the portrait describe how real and beautiful it is. Although she is dead, she is painted so life-like in the portrait.

The dark gloominess of the abandoned house is a classic background for a gothic story. The painter is the symbol of the fanaticism. The woman in the oval portrait, is the victim of painter’s passion for art. The oval portrait symbolizes the immortality of art. The frame is the symbol of the general objectification she faced as a physically attractive woman.

**f. What does the expression “she was dead!” mean?**

&#x279E; The expression ‘She was dead!’ means the painter’s realization of the death of his beloved because of his devotion to the portrait. His wife remains in an obedient pose for many weeks. As the work continues her health becomes increasingly poor. However, the painter does not notice the worsening condition of his wife, continuing to paint desperately, without taking his eyes off the canvas. Given the last brush stroke, the painter is delighted with the liveliness of his creation, but turning to his wife, he realizes that she is dead.


#### Reference beyond the text

**a. Do you think there is life in art?**


&#x279E;  I don’t think there is life in art. Art is just a creation to display which has meanings related to different things. But, in a literal sense, artists create life in art. They try to find out life within the art.

**b. As a thing of art nothing could be more admirable than the painting itself. Explain.**


&#x279E; This statement is absolutely right about painting. Painting is really a very admirable form of art. The painters really work hard to create quality paintings with meanings. The painting itself speaks in its literal manner. Painting provides us with facts related to life. Here in this story, the oval portrait is one of the finest examples which has startled thenarrator. He feels completely puzzled to see that painting. He wants to know about its and painter.

**c. A more intense look at the painting reveals the illusion. Have you noticed any such painting?**

&#x279E; Yes, I have noticed such painting. The painting becomes more meaningful when it is watched by the viewer who is passionate about paintings. But, for those viewers who don’t have an idea about paintingsfind illusion all the time. In my case, I watched a typical painting for a long time but I didn’t get meaningsabout it. I tried a lot to grasp its meaning but vain. Later on, I got its meaning from my friend.
