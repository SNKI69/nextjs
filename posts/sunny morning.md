#### g. What is the effect of flashback in the play when Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo knew that they were the lovers in the past?
&#x21d2; A flashback is a dramatic technique in which earlier events are inserted into a narrative's normal chronological flow. Flashback has played an important role in making this romantic comedy very artistic and dramatic. When Don Gonzalo and Dona Laura discovered that they had been lovers in the past, their flashback stories began to tell us about various events from their romantic youth. This play has been expanded with a variety of hidden facts as a result of their flashback. Because of its use, the play has a variety of concealing and revealing twists, as well as a satisfying climax. Both characters continue to use flashback stories with various information, which has made the entire audience pay attention and enjoy every single dialogue of the play. The foundation of this amusing play can be thought of as a flashback.

#### h. Discuss how the play is built around humour and irony.
&#x21d2; Humour and irony have been combined beautifully in the play in order to entertain and refresh the audiences. This play begins with old Dona Laura's amusing dialogue. After Gonzalo enters the park, the sarcastic arguments between both old people create an extremely humorous environment in the play. There's a lot of irony in both characters 'pinching words. When they realize they know each other, they begin telling their flashback stories, which arouse the readers' interest and makes them want to hear more from the characters. Their way of interacting with ironic remarks, their false stories about their deaths,their methods of concealing their identities to fool each other, their promise to meet the next sunny morning, and so on have added to the humour and irony of the play.

#### i. How is the title ‘A Sunny Morning’ justifiable? Discuss.
&#x21d2; This play is set in a park in Madrid, Spain on a sunny morning. The entire actions of the play have been enacted on this setting. A sunny morning has provided an ideal setting for the reunion of two former lovers in their golden years. It is because of the sunny morning that Don Gonzalo and Dona Laura come to the park and spend their time leisurely. They argue, come to know about each other, conceal their identities, admire, tell fabricated stories about their deaths. They also promise to meet each other the next sunny morning. As the sunny morning provides an ideal setting for the reunion of two lovers, the title of the play is appropriate.

#### a. What do you predict will happen in the next meeting between Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo? Discuss
&#x21d2; I think that will be more enthusiastic to meet each other the next day.Don Gonzalo will also bring some bread crumbs and both of them feed the pigeons together. The next day also, they will express their emotions through fictitious means. They will both try to make each other happy.Don Gonzalo will undoubtedly be more forthright this time. He will make an effort to show his appreciation for her. Readers will be able to see their shyness. They will undoubtedly have a lot more fun with their pretentious acts.

#### b. Was it wise for Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo to keep their identities secret? How might their secrets affect future meetings?
&#x21d2;  I don’t think it was wise for Don and Laura to hide their identities. It would make their future meeting shallow and unrealistic. It would prevent them from expressing their true emotion. They would soon be tired of telling lies.
