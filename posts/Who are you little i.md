### Unit 2 : Who are you little i

***-E E Cummings***

**Answer these questions**

**a. Have you ever looked out through a window and taken pleasure in what you saw? If so, what did you look at?**

&#x279E; Whenever I am free, or feeling lonely in vacant days, I stand by my window, looking out through it. The different activities outside give me pleasure.

I live on the second floor of a building near a bus stop. So my window overlooks the bus stop. Naturally it is full of activities like buses coming or going. Passengers mostly making a lot of noise. The hawkers selling things like apples, peanuts or biscuits etc.

(The scene of a typical bus station) 

**d. Which beautiful scenes do you think would make you want to look out through the window ?**

&#x279E; Well, this depends on which mood I am in . But, mostly I like natural scenes. I like the clear blue sky, with little pieces of white clouds. Mostly I enjoy scenes of sunrise. I feel happy and full of positivity
with the rising sun.

**e. Do you write pronoun ‘I’ capital or small in writing ?**

&#x279E; Yes, I always write the pronoun ‘I’ in capital. We capitalize it because it refers to an individual. If it is written in lower case, people will think it to be a typographical error.

#### Understanding the text

**a. Who can be the speaker of this poem ?**

&#x279E; Mostly poets use a literary element called ‘Speaker’. Speaker is the person voicing the words. Here the speaker is an adult person who recalls his childhood. Perhaps the speaker is the poet himself.

**b. What is “little I” doing ?**

&#x279E;  The “little I” is looking out a window at the end of the day. He is enjoying the beautiful scene of sunset.

**c. What can be the relationship between the “little I” and the speaker of the poem ?**

&#x279E; The “little I” is the childhood of the speaker himself, and the speaker is the child grown-up. So we can say that the “little I” is the child version of the speaker.

**d. What is the speaker remembering from his childhood days in the poem ?**

&#x279E;  The speaker is remembering how he used to enjoy natural scenes like sunset. He used to get pleasure from such sights.

**e. What attitude does the speaker seem to have toward the child in the poem ?**

&#x279E; The speaker seems to have a positive, nostalgic attitude towards the child. He feels a youthful presence in himself still now, who inspires him now to look out and enjoy the nature outside. 

#### Reference to the context

**a. Why do you think Cummings has placed a semicolon between the words window and at ?**

&#x279E; The poet has used the semicolon (;) between the two words to provide a break in the long sentence while keeping the thought flowing. In such situations a semicolon works stronger than a comma as in the present sentence structure.

**b. If the speaker is the child grown up, why does he ask, “who are you” ?**

&#x279E; There is no doubt that the speaker is the child grown up. Still he puts the question. It may be because he is struggling to recall the wonderment of his youthful days.

Or may be, it is his incredulity that there is still a youthful presence in himself enjoying the nature.

**c. In this poem, an adult reflects on the childhood experie nce. Based on that, what might be thetheme of the lines: “(and feeling: that if day / has to become night /this is a beautiful way)” ?**

&#x279E; The clear theme of these lines is ‘death’. It is a touchy way to describe an unwelcome transition from the joyful youth to the end of life.

**d. What is the rhyme scheme used in the poem ?**

&#x279E; Rhyme scheme is the pattern of sounds that repeat at the end of a line or stanza. The rhyme scheme of this poem is : AB AB CD EF

**e. : Explain the pun in “little I” that is related to what he is doing ?**

&#x279E; Pun is a type of word play which exploits multiple meanings (more than one meanings). Pun sometimes suggests different meanings.

It is the writing style of the poet to uncapitalize the first person pronoun ‘I’. By adding ‘little’ in ‘little I’ he expresses the boy to be very little.

One meaning of it is the boy is a little child in comparison to his present adulthood. Another meaning might be that he lowers the importance of self in regards to his experience.

**e. How does Cumming’s use of lower case letters affect your understanding of the poem? Explain.**

&#x279E; His use of lower case letters gives us a smaller feel. It gives the feeling of being smaller in comparison to time. It deemphasizes the self and promotes the time.

#### Reference beyond the text.

**a. How does nature inspire the speaker in “who are you, little I”? Explain.**

&#x279E; It inspires him by going back to his youthhood and enjoying such a beautiful natural scene. Hehad almost forgotten it in the long pressure of adulthood.

**b. Recall a childhood moment when you felt closely connected with nature. Describe the time andplace as well as the feelings and thoughts about it.**

&#x279E; I was born and raised in the busy city of Kathmandu. My father works there. I grew up in the midst of the city, with little connection to nature. As I was about to take my school graduation exams my father announced that we would go to our native village in the long vacation. My happiness knew no bound. It like a dream coming true. Finally I was in my native village. It was so different. Opposite to the hustle and bustle of the busy city, it was so calm and tranquil. It was first time I saw a milking cow. Otherwise I used to think that all produce come from super markets or dairies. The next morning my grand pa took me to our paddy field. I was surprised to see the vast stretch of greenery. It was so different from the concrete jungle of the place where I live.
