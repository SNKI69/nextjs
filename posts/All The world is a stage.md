***Answer the following questions***

**a. Why does the poet compare the world with a stage?**

&#x279E; The poet compares the world to a stage because he thought all men and women behave like the actors of a drama.

**b. What is the first stage in a human's life? In what sense can it be a troubling stage?**

&#x279E; The last stage of a man is known as his second childhood. A child can not see, hear, smell and taste anything, during childhood. When a man grow old, slowly he loses his senses of sight, hearing, smell and taste like the child. So this stage of his life is considered as second childhood.

***c. Read the given lines and answer the questions that follow.***

***a) Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel And shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school.***

***i.  Which stage of life is being referred to here by the poet?***

&#x279E; The second stage of life is being referred to here by the poet.

***ii. Which figure of speech has been employed in the second line?***

&#x279E; Creeping like snail - simile

&#x279E; No, the boy doesn’t go to the school willingly. 

***d. Simile and metaphor are the major two poetic devices used in this poem. Explain citing examples of each.***

&#x279E;  Simile and metaphor literary devices used in speech and writing to make comparisons. Each is used in a different way.

 A simile is a figure of speech that compares two dissimilar things using the words 'as' or 'like'. For

example

"Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel

And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school".

Here the school going boy is compared with a snail.

A metaphor is a figure of speech that directly compares one thing with the other.

“All the world’s a stage,

And all the men and women merely players.”

This is an example of a metaphor. Shakespeare is comparing the world to a stage by saying one is theother. However, he does not mean 
 this literally. (In other words, he doesn’t literally believe the world is a stage.) The comparison is rhetorical. By comparing the world to a stage, and the people in the world as players on it, he is inviting us to think about the similarities between the two, and by extension, the meaning of human nature and our place in the world.

***e. Which style does the poet use to express his emotions about how he thinks that the world is a stage and all the people living in it are mere players?***

&#x279E; The poet uses the figure of speech known as metaphor to express his emotions about how he thinks that the world is a stage and all the people living in it are mere players. Here the poet compares the world with the stage and the people living in it are compared with the players in a drama.

***f. What is the theme of this poem?***

&#x279E; The theme of the poem is that a man's lifetime undergoes seven distinct stages, through which each individual plays parts in life as actors play upon a stage in a theater.

#### Reference beyond the text

**a) Describe the various stages of a man’s life picturised in the poem “All the World’s a stage.”**

&#x279E; According to Shakespeare, the world is a stage and everyone is a player. He says that every man has seven stages during his life time. The first stage of a man is childhood. He plays in the arms of his mother. He often vomits and cries in this stage. In his second stage, the man is an unwilling school going student. He becomes a lover in his third stage. He is very busy composing ballads for his beloved and yearns for her attention. In the fourth stage, he is aggressive and ambitious. He seeks reputation in all what he does. He is ready to guard his country and becomes a soldier. In his fifth stage, he becomes a fair judge with maturity and wisdom. In the sixth stage, he is seen with loose pantaloons and spectacles. His manly voice changes into a childish treble. The last stage of all is his second childhood. Slowly, he loses his faculties of sight, hearing, smell and taste and exits from the roles of his life. Thus Shakespeare pictures the seven stages of a man’s life in the poem ‘All the World’s a Stage’.

**b) Is Shakespeare's comparison of human life with drama stage apt? How?** 

**Or**

**Shakespeare has skilfully brought out the parallels between the life of man and actors on stage. Elaborate this statement with reference to the poem.**

&#x279E; Shakespeare considers the whole world a stage where men and women are only actors. In a drama, every player enters the stage, acts his/her part and then exits. In the same way, We enter in this world by birth. We lead our life in different characters. We exit from this world at the time of our death. Shakespeare says that every man has seven stages during his life time. In a drama, a player loves his beloved for the sake of the play. At the end, the players say goodbyes and part away. In real life, husband and wife lead their life till death knocks at their door. Like the drama’s end, death parts them. The players in the drama really wants the reputation for their performance. For fame and name, they give their best on the stage. A man in the fourth stage also is an aggressive and ambitious. He seeks reputation in all what he does, like the player in the drama. Thus Shakespeare has skilfully brought out the parallels between the life of man and actors on stage.
