&#x279E; No, It is not good to have a conflict between friendship and love because these are the relationships which are very essential for an individual. True friends and loved ones always care for each other. They shed light on your qualities, both positive and bad, and improve self-esteem. Via laughter and good times, friends help relieve tension and hardship. They will help you move forward.

As long as your love and intension are pure towards the person, it is not morally bad for two-person having the same feelings for the third one. Knowingly or Unknowingly, this type of condition may arise ina person’s life. Although it is not bad,possibilities are high for the problems to arise in the near future. So, the only solution is to talk with each other and solve the problem by controlling your emotions.
