***But have you ever counted***

***Because of you and your wars?***

&#x279E; These beautiful lines have been taken from Vishnu S. Rai’s wonderful poem “Corona Says”. Here, we find corona as the main speaker who is talking to a man of the present world. The speaker is saying to 
the men about the bad aspects of war. He wants to make the men realise about the impacts of inhumane wars. Here, the speaker is blaming the human for killing many people through their wars. He is asking about the calculation of dead people that have been invited by humans’ war.

**b. Explain the following:**

***I will depart one day.***

***There’re many others like me.***

***They’ll come too.***

***If you don’t get rid of your inflated ego,***

***You’ll be back to your cave time***

***That you endured***

***Long, l o n g, l o n g ago …***

&#x279E;  These beautiful lines have been taken from Vishnu S. Rai’s wonderful poem “Corona Says”. Here, we find corona as the main speaker who is talking to a man of the present world. Here, the speaker is warning the human about future circumstances. He is informing him about his fellows who are similar tohim. He says that one day he will depart from the planet but if humans don’t get rid of their inflated egos, they (fellows) will come too. In that critical situation, humans will be back to the caves as before (the stone age). That will be the worst situation for humans. 

**c. What does the speaker mean in the following lines? Explain.**

The earth is not your property alone –

It’s as much ours as yours.

&#x279E; Here, Corona as a speaker is making the human realise that the mother (Earth) belongs to all the creatures not only the humans. He reminds the human saying that the mother (Earth) isn’t their property alone. He claims that the earth belongs to other creatures also apart from humans.

#### Reference beyond the text  

**a. What human behaviours are responsible for suffering in people’s lives?**

&#x279E; The human behaviours are the sole cause behind all these sufferings of the people. Due to human egos and bad deeds, the present world is facing a crisis. Many people have lost their lives during this critical period. Due to their selfish nature, the earth and its people have faced numerous problems of diseases. Their so-called egos and wars have snatched the lives of many peopRos.

**b. How does an epidemic differ from a pandemic? Briefly explain the impact of Corona Virus on human life and environment.**
