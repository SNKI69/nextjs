### Critical thinking

**a. All children have the right to quality education. How can we ensure this right to every child? Discuss the role of the government and the parents to make sure that every child can attend school.**

&#x21d2; All the children have the right to quality education not a single child should be held back due to poverty,recism, religious background or any other social or mental discrimination. As a responsible citizen, we can ensure this right to every child by evaluating their proper implemention.

we can also ensure this right to every child by counselling their parents and well as their kinds about important of education in current world scenario to make sure that every child can attend school the goverment and parents must come forward to play vital role in this regart. The goverment should make laws which advocate the rights to quality education for children and must implement it properly. It must aware about the balanced food proper clothing and regular health check up and other basic needs of children.

As fact as the role of parents is concern they must provide their child a learning environment with proper hygine and sanitation. They must motivate him/her to acquire education 

##### b. Do you think that there is still discrimination between sons and daughters in terms of providing education in our country? What strategies do you suggest toovercome such discrimination against girls? 

&#x21d2; Yes,In my view there is still discrimination between son and daughter  in terms of providing education in remote poor and less education societies and place of Nepal. They are sending boy to school but daughter to household activities.

A human society is consist of men and women. In both men and human are calculated then, they can equally play their role. But in contest of Nepal parents provide quality of education to boy but not to their daughter cause they says daughter means doing household activites.

In most places of our country daughter are neglected parents provide quality of education to boy but not to their daughter cause theys says daughter means doings household activites and means of reproduction for future generation many parents believes in superstitions to send any son to school and not to daughter.

The strategies that can suggest to overcome such discrimination is that goverment should makes rule that both son and daughter should have right to education. There should be implementation of programof free and compulsary education to both there should be removed of school cultural and religious system that comple people to discriminate between son and daughter.
