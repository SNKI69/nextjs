> ### Reference beyond the text 

**1. The play is a satire on the present day education system. Do you think that our  education system does not prepare students for life? Discuss**

&#x21d2; The one act play, ‘Refund’ is a satire on contemporary education system of our country. As the play suggests, our education system does not prepare the students for life. The students are taught high sounding theories, philosophies and concepts, but they are not totally relevant to the practical lives of the students. Even after getting university degree, the students are not skillful and practical enough to solve many problems of their life. They still need to depend on others for their survival. They lack good manner and humility. They don’t know how to behave with the elders and teachers. This play clearly reflects what a student learns at school through the character, Wasserkopf. 

**2. Our education system focuses on memorisation rather than creative thinking. Do you think the knowledge imparted by education may not have practical relevance in one’s day-to-day life? Who do you blame for this?**

&#x21d2; Our education system focuses on memory based education rather than creative thinking of the students. The individual needs, skills, abilities and expectations are not counted. Teacher is regarded as the only one source of all knowledge. The teacher pumps the same knowledge to every student in the same way. As a result, the creativity and skill of individual student cannot be blossomed. That’s why the students fail in the exams of their lives.

The education system itself, the educational institutions, teachers and the students are all responsible for this situation. All focus on the marks and grades rather than the significance of knowledge and skills in practical life.

**3. Most of the students want to learn just for examination rather than knowledge. Do you think that certificate will help them in their future career?**

&#x21d2; I don’t think that certificates alone helps the students in their future career. There are certain fields like medicine, teaching, aeronautics, banking and insurance where performance matters more than grades and marks. No doubt, every one needs certificates, but certificates alone can’t help. In real life, one has to prove his worth again and again. Intelligence, experience , inter personal and intra personal skills count more than university degree to get through the exams of life.
