### Answer the following questions.
**1. Do you believe that Mrs. Wright killed her husband? Explain.**

&#x21d2; I believe that Mrs. Wright have killed her husband. Mrs. Wright was a pretty and timid woman who loved singing. She had brought a canary toaccompany her during the day. Her husband, though a good man and didnot drink, was rather hard man. He did not like the singing bird. So , hekilled the bird. As Mrs. Wright could not tolerate the death of her canary,she took revenge against her husband by strangling him.

**2. Do you think Mr. Wright’s death would have been uncovered if Mr. Hale hadn’t stopped by the Wrights’ home?**


&#x21d2; I don’t think that the death of Mr. Wright would have been uncovered so
soon if Mr. Hale had not stopped by the Wrights house. Mr. Wright had been killed the previous night and Mrs. Wright had not informed anyoneof his death till 8 o clock next morning. It meant that she did not intendto disclose the murder of her husband. Therefore, his death would not have been revealed so soon.

**3. Why does Mrs. Hale think that Mrs. Wright’s worries about her preserves indicate her innocence?**


&#x21d2; Mrs. Hale thinks that Mrs. Wright's worries about her preserves indicate her innocence. Mrs. was worried that the fire would go outand her jars containing preserve would break. A woman who was soworried about her housekeeping can’t murder her husband. Herattention to detail in her housekeeping skills demonstrates herinnocence. 

**4. How does Mrs. Peters’ homesteading experience connect her to Mrs. Wright?**


&#x21d2; Both Mrs. Peters and Mrs. Wright have gone through the same experience in their lives. While Mrs. Peters was a girl, she had a kitten at her home. In front of her eyes, a boy killed it with a hatchet ( asmallaxe). She was so angry with the boy that she wanted to hurt him. Mrs. Wright too might have felt same kind of anger against her husband for killing the canary. This anger led her to kill her husband.

**5. How do the women’s perspectives on men differ?**


&#x21d2; In the play, ‘Trifles’ the arrogance and dominance of male have been contrasted with the sensitivity and practicality of women. The women characters investigate on the minute details of Mrs. Wright’s belongings, which the male characters dismiss as trifles. The female characters understand how Mrs. might was suppressed by her husband and sympathize with her. Therefore, they hide the evidences that would justify her as a convict. On the other hand, the males constantly look for the evidences to justify Mrs. Wright as a convict. Throughout the play, the males show their superiority over women and make fun of them.

#### a) “MRS. PETERS:(glancing around). Seems funny to think of a bird here. But she must have had one, or why would she have a cage? I wonder what happened to it? MRS. HALE: I s’pose maybe the cat got it.”

&#x21d2; <li> She’ refers to Mrs.Wright. 

<li> ‘ One’ stands for a bird. 

<li> The full form of “s’pose” is suppose.

<li> “The cat got it” means it caught the bird.

#### b) "MRS. HALE: Wright was close. …… she used to wear pretty clothes and be lively, when she was Minnie Foster, one of the town girls singing in the choir.

&#x21d2; <li> Mrs. Hall refers to Mrs. Wright as “Minnie Foster” because she was fond of singing songs like Mark Derek Foster, an American singer,songwriter, and musician.

<li> Her description tells us that Mrs. Wright was a lively girl fond of wearing beautiful dress and singing songs before her marriage

<li> By "that was thirty years ago", Mrs. Hale refers to the period in Mrs. Wright's life when she was an unmarried and well-known singer known as Minnie Foster.

#### c. What is the main theme of the play?

&#x21d2; The main theme of the play is differing attitudes of males and females towards justice. The male characters look for the evidences that would prove Mrs. Wright as a convict. They move up and down looking for the evidences, but find none. On the other hand, the female characters find the evidences that can prove Mrs. Wright as a convict. However, they understand how it feels to be suppressed by the males. Therefore, they sympathize with her and decide to hide the evidences against her. Hence, this play presents how the attitude of females towards justice differ from that of the males.

#### d. Discuss the symbolism used in the play?

&#x21d2; The major symbols used in the play are: 
##### The quilt : 
Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters decide to bring the quilt to Minnie in jail. The quilt and Minnie’s decision to finish it in one of two styles—quilting or knotting is developed as a metaphor for her innocence or her guilt. The act of knotting a quilt is linked to the act of killing a man with a rope around hisneck. The play ends with George Henderson asking the women how Minnie was going to finish the quilt. Mrs. Hale’s certainty that she was going to“knotit” symbolizes the women’s certainty that Minnie killed her husband. Meanwhile, the men, blinded by their arrogant inability to see the women’s interest as anything but trifles, don’t catch this significance at all.

##### The bird:
The strangled songbird that Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters discover explains the motivation behind Minnie Wright’s crime. It also also symbolizes John Wright’s abusive treatment of his wife. Minnie is linked to the bird through Mrs. Hale’s memory of her as a young unmarried woman who liked to sing. Like the dead bird, Minnie was once bright and filled with life, but this energy and vitality was strangled out of her by life with John Wright, by her married life caught in a patriarchal society living with a hard man. The bird also symbolizes Minnie’s need for companionship in her childless home, and the death of the bird shows that her husband kills the source of happiness in her life.

##### The dirty towel:
This is one of many out-of-place objects in Minnie’s kitchen that cause George Henderson to accuse her of being a poor housekeeper. The mess of Minnie’s kitchen demonstrates a distressed mind and that Minnie’s act of killing her husband was more emotional and dramatic than her demeanor indicates. In addition, the mess in the kitchen symbolizes the ways in which the men in this play expect women to fulfill certain gender roles. Minnie, not John, is held responsible for the state of the house and is seen as unfit for her role of wife. It is precisely this sort of judgment, and the fact that the men are so comfortable in judging women, that isolates Minnie in the first place.

#### e. Discuss the setting of the play. Does it have an impact on the theme of the play?

&#x21d2; Setting refers to the time and location in which the action of a play,story or novel take place. The actions of this one act play take place in an abandoned country house of Mr. and Mrs. Wright, especially in the kitchen. The male characters move upstairs and down in the barn looking for the evidences against Mrs. Wright, where as the female characters spend mostof their time in the kitchen pondering on the ‘kitchen things’. The kitchen is quite messy. There are many signs of incomplete tasks. As the weather is quite cold, it must be a winter day. Therefore, the characters surround the stove. This setting is quite significant in understanding the theme of the play. The cold weather and the messy kitchen reflect the cold and unharmonious relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Wright.

**1. The credibility of a character is determined not only by the character’s thoughts and actions but also by what other characters say and think about him or her. Discuss in relation to the characters of Trifles.**

&#x21d2;  The credibility of a character is determined not only by the character’s thoughts and actions but also by what others say and think about him or her. In the play, Trifles Mrs. Wright has been suspected of murdering her husband and has been put in police custody. Though she is the central character of the play, she is completely offstage. As readers, we get most of the information about Mr. and Mrs. Wright from Mrs. Peters and Mrs. Hale. Through them we come to know the hidden conflict between Mr. and Mrs. Wright. It allows us to conclude that Mrs. Wright herself might be the person who killed Mr. Wright. So,people’s opinion about somebody is as important as the thought and actions of the person in determining his /her credibility.


**2. Dramatic irony occurs when the reader or audience has information that is unknown to the characters in a play; it creates tension and suspense. Analyse the play discussing the author’s use of dramatic irony based on these questions:**

**What information is crucial to the play Trifles?**

**How does the playwright use this information to create dramatic irony?** 

**What effect does the dramatic irony have on the audience and on the play?**


&#x21d2; Dramatic irony occurs when the readers and the audiences know the information that the characters in a play are unknown about. In order to convict Mrs. Wright as the murderer of her husband, it is crucial to understand her mental state that led her to commit such serious crime. As a housewife, her state of mind could be understood by analyzing the state of the things in the kitchen. The unwashed pan under the sink, loaf of bread outside the breadbox and dish towel on the table clearly express the troubled state of her mind. The broken door of the bird cage and the dead canary are enough suggest the conflict between Mrs. Wright and her husband. But the males, who are in charge of investigation, dismiss these details as ‘kitchen things’. Their male superiority stops them from paying attention to these details and from finding the reality. For open minded readers these details are significant clues about the death of Mr. Wright.This dramatic irony make the play more artistic and creates a sense of suspense and tension among the reader.
